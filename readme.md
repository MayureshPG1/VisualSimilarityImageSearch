### Problem Statement

Design and implement a system that computes visual similarity. Think of a visual search engine that provides you with similar
searches when given an image input.

### Problem Definition

The problem to be solved is of searching images based on visual similarity. The dataset provides labeled data of all images but I am not going to use that for finding similar images. If we use labels, this would become a Natural Language Processing kind of problem.
